One of my OOP exam tasks could be turned into the Classic DOTA game.

There is a three types of heroes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence.
They start the game with base stats.
You could add common items to the hero's inventory and add recipes. If a hero already have the recipe's required items - a new item is made of them.

Game commands:
(keep the correct line input as shown below, so you could use the game commands correctly)
If you put a wrong command or input - you'll get an error and you can try again.


Adding a new hero:
"Hero" + "TYPE YOUR HERO NAME" + "CHOOSE YOUR TYPE OF HERO"(Strength,Agility or Intelligence);


Adding a new item:
"Item" + "TYPE YOUR ITEM NAME" + "Strength Bonus(Digit)" + "Agility Bonus(Digit)" + "Intelligence Bonus(Digit)" + "HitPoints Bonus(Digit)" + "Damage Bonus(Digit)";


Adding a new recipe:
"Recipe" + "TYPE YOUR RECIPE NAME" + "Strength Bonus(Digit)" + "Agility Bonus(Digit)" + "Intelligence Bonus(Digit)" + "HitPoints Bonus(Digit)" + "Damage Bonus(Digit)" + "varargs of required items(String)";


Get hero stats:
"Info" + "Hero Name";

Quit the game:
"Quit".
